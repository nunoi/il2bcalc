IL2 Bombsight Calculator

This web page allows you to automate wind calculations in IL2 bombsight.

You must provide the plane's heading, the wind's heading and speed and 
it will calculate the wind angle relative to the plane flight path. 
Speed is just for show since it is not altered, but why not.

It uses jQuery-Knob implementation by Anthony Terrien.

Its license is reproduced in LICENSE.knob file as well as HTML page.
